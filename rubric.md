## Technical Requirements

### Back-end

- Your API includes at least 2 models, one of which may be a user
- Your models include at least one association
- Your API has RESTful routes as appropriate

> API contains more then 2 models. Seems to be a decent amount of associations. Would be cool if there was  a has_many :through association like in rails for user comments and schools, so he could see all the schools hes commented on. I like that your API routes were exactly what you wanted and didn't include some of the RESTful routes that you didn't need. Handrolled user auth is definitely a plus as well. Additionally, sometimes the moneys in the data. Parsing information into a backend can certainly be difficult. The scraper was INTENSE, i'm still curious about those 2 long ass lines of code though. Great job. Exceeds expectations

### Front-end

- Your app provides a reasonable user experience
- Your view(s) includes at least one AJAX request that allows a user to somehow interact with the API
- Your code, as rendered in the browser, passes a [CSS validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and an [HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

> Your code contained multiple AJAX requests. The structure of the JS was pretty organized and well abstracted. I encourage you to switch out the mapping JS into a more OOJS approach as well. Though it is perfectly fine to take a mixed approach. Definitely take some time to knock out the bug with comments. Other than that looked great. CSS was nice and clean looked great! Other minor issue just resides in user experience. Thought it is relatively obvious what to do, theres just not too much meat to it in general. That being said, exceeds expectations

---

### Code Quality

Your code follows the styles we've covered in class: DRY, easy to read,
well-commented.

> Code is well commented, easy to read. Lots of functionality was abstracted and the separation of concerns looks pretty good. Not much else to say here. Good work. Exceeds Expectations

### Submission

- One person from your team should file an issue on the [pbj-project3-gallery repo](https://github.com/ga-dc/pbj-project3-gallery). The issue should contain:
  - A link to **your group's main Github repo**.
  - At least 3 specific areas of code on which you would like targeted feedback (agree on these as a team)
  - Any other comments or questions
- Your submitted Github repository includes a `planning` folder that contains:
  - Evidence of planning (e.g. user stories, ERDs, and wireframe)
- Your repository includes a link to the deployed version of your project in the repository `URL` field
- The repository includes a `readme.md` file containing:
  - A description of the project
  - A couple paragraphs about the general approach you took
  - Installation instructions for any dependencies
  - Descriptions of any unsolved problems or major hurdles your team had to overcome

> Readme is great. Lots of detailed planning went into this! Loved the groups planning folder. I definitely couldn't view one of those scraper files in atom though for some reason. Looking at it on git hub, what is going on with that one line of code? that looks intense. Exceeds expectations

---

### Deployment and functionality

- Your application is deployed to Heroku (hint: use `heroku rename` to give your app a nice URL)
- Cursory use of your app yields no errors that "break" your app

> The app was great! deployed successfully. The only thing not working fluidly was the commenting. Hard to pinpoint where the breakdown was. Site looks pretty good. ~ Meets/exceeds expectations.


Overall great job. Didn't expect anything less from this group! Seemed like the team worked well together and the planning and scheduling worked pretty well.  Let me know if you guys have any questions/comments/concerns about any of the code comments i've left as well as this rubric.
